[Advent Of Vue](https://adventofvue.com) is a series of 24 Vue coding challenges that are sent out every day from December 1 to December 24 via [a dedicated newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/AdventOfVue). If you'd like to receive more of these puzzles in the future, go ahead and sign up!

## Problem description

Fortunately, we got lucky this year and were gifted a lot of presents! But look at this chaos... Wouldn't it be nice if we could sort all of our presents by their dimensions?

- We want to sort the presents by their surface area (width \* height, small to big).
- Add a button with the name `Toggle sort` that makes it possible to toggle sorting.
- Hint: use `computed()` for best results.
- Hint: you can run the tests with `npm run test` to see if your solution matches the specification.

If you like how, in this example, you can check your implementation with an existing test, you might be interested in my [book/newsletter about how to write good tests for Vue applications](https://goodvuetests.com/).
